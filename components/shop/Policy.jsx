        All of our bounces are large in size measuring 15&apos; x 15&apos;,
        allowing up to 10 children to enjoy the fun at a time (depending on age,
        and size). To prevent sun burn in HOTLANTA, our bounces are roof covered
        allowing viewing and air circulation from netted sides. All equipment is
        sanitized on the same day of delivery to ensure clean and safe fun!
        <br />

        Ensure there is at least 20&apos; x 20&apos; of flat grass surface for
        installation.
